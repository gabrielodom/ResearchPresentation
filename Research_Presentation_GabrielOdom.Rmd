# Introduction
  
## Introduction

- In multivariate contexts, the number of parameters to estimate increases quadratically with dimension $\left(p + \frac{p}{2}(p + 1)\right)$.
- Linear dimension reduction (LDR) allows us to simplify complex data structures to more simple data structures via linear combinations of features.
- LDR is built around eigen-decomposition / principal component analysis (PCA) or the singular value decomposition (SVD).


## LDR Benefits

- increase model parsimony
- reduce computational complexity and costs
- reduce the effect of the *curse of dimensionality*
- reduce storage costs
- reduce feature redundancy


# Poorly-Posed Heteroscedastic Classification

## The Problem Defined
- We want to classify observations from different elliptical distributions (distributions with negligible higher-order moments).
- Covariance matrices for each class are sufficiently unequal, implying that pooling these estimates will lead to classifier degredation.
- Real examples are often poorly posed ($n_i < p ^ 2 / 2$), thus class precision matrix estimates are unstable.
- We introduce a shrinkage estimator to class covariance matrices which uses the bias-variance tradeoff to stabilize these etimates.
- We employ dimension reduction to increase classifier speed and accuracy.

## Notation
Consider a data matrix $\textbf{X}$ containing $n$ observations from $K$ distinct $p$-dimensional elliptical distributions, with class means $\boldsymbol\mu_k$ and class covariances $\boldsymbol\Sigma_k \in \mathbb{R}^{>}_p$, for $k \in 1, \ldots, K$. Furthermore, define

 - $\bar{\textbf{x}}_k$ is the sample mean vector for the $k^{th}$ class
 - $\textbf{S}_k$ is the sample covariance matrix for the $k^{th}$ class
 - $\alpha_k$ is the *a priori* probability of class membership for the $k^{th}$ class
 - $\bar{\textbf{x}} := \sum^K_{k = 1}\alpha_k\bar{\textbf{x}}_k$ is the grand mean
 - $\textbf{S}_W := \sum_{k = 1}^K\alpha_k\textbf{S}_k$ is the sample within-class covariance
 - $\textbf{S}_B := \sum^K_{k = 1}\left( \bar{\textbf{x}}_k - \bar{\textbf{x}} \right) \left( \bar{\textbf{x}}_k - \bar{\textbf{x}} \right)^T$ is the sample between-class covariance
 - $\widehat{\boldsymbol\Gamma} := \textbf{S}_B + \textbf{S}_W$ is the estimated marginal covariance of the data matrix

## Current Approaches

The following are all different methods which calculate a *data sufficiency matrix*, a matrix that contains functions of all the sufficient statistics of the data.

 - SY from @ounpraseuth_linear_2015
 - LD from @loog_linear_2004
 - Sliced Average Variance Estimation (SAVE) from @cook_sliced_1991
 - Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR) from @li_sliced_1991
 

 
## SYS: Our New Method
Replace the MLE estimators for class covariances with the Haff Shrinkage Estimator in the data sufficiency matrix. That is
\[
\widehat{\textbf{M}}_{SYS} := \left[ \tilde{\textbf{S}}^{-1}_{2}\bar{\textbf{x}}_2 - \tilde{\textbf{S}}^{-1}_{1}\bar{\textbf{x}}_1\ \vdots\ \cdots\ \vdots\  \tilde{\textbf{S}}^{-1}_{K}\bar{\textbf{x}}_K - \tilde{\textbf{S}}^{-1}_{1}\bar{\textbf{x}}_1\ \vdots\ \textbf{S}_2 - \textbf{S}_1\ \vdots\ \cdots\ \vdots\ \textbf{S}_K - \textbf{S}_1 \right].
\]
The precision shrinkage estimator is
\[
\tilde{\textbf{S}}^{-1}_k := \left( 1 - t(U_k) \right)\left(n_k - p - 2 \right)\textbf{S}^{-1}_k + \frac{t(U_k)\left(pn_k - p - 2 \right)}{\text{tr}\left(\textbf{S}_k\right)}\textbf{I}_p,
\]
where
\[
t(U_k) := \min\left\{ \frac{4\left(p^2 - 1\right)}{\left(n_k - p - 2 \right)p^2},1 \right\} U^{1/p}_k,\ \text{and}\ U_k := \frac{p \left|\textbf{S}_k \right|^{1/p}}{\text{tr}\left(\textbf{S}_k\right)}.
\]

## Simulation Setup

 - The synthetic data has three classes.
 - We draw 5,000 observations from three $p = 10$-dimensional normal distributions.
 - The true data sufficency matrix $\textbf{M}$ given the known parameters has rank 2.
 - We chose $n_i = 15$ as the training sample size to induce a poorly-posed scenario.
 - Using the five competing methods, we reduced the data dimension from 10 to $1, \ldots, 9$.
 - For each dimension within each method, we built the quadratic classifier and classified the remaining 4,985 observation in the test data set.
 - We repeated this process 2,500 times to effectively remove simulation error.

## Simulation Results
```{r, out.width = "810px", out.height = "500px", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/gabrielodom/Box Sync/Research/Presentations/Miami_Interview/HLDR_CER_Graph.pdf")
```

## Simulation Results Discussion

 - The vertical axis (abscissa) is the conditional error rate (CER). This is the proportion of the nearly-15,000 testing observations which were incorrectly classified.
 - The horizontal axis (ordinate) is the reduced feature dimension.
 - The coloured boxplots represent the empirical distribution of the 2,500 CERs for each data sufficiency matrix.
 - The CER without dimension reduction is the red line at 0.49, which is still better than random guessing for three classes.
 - Overall minimum Median CER is 32%, achieved by the SYS method in reduced dimension 2.
 - When we increase the ratio of $n$ to $p$, SYS approaches SY (not shown).

 
## Ionosphere Data
- The radar data from @sigillito_classification_1989 was collected by a signal collection system in Goose Bay, Labrador.
- These observations are measurements on radar signals broadcasted into the ionosphere.
- Based on atmospheric conditions, these signals passed through the ionosphere (bad) or were suitable for further analysis on the ground (good).
- There is a high cost associated with analysing "bad" observations, so we aim to classify an observation before analysis.

## Cross-Validation Setup
- The observations have $p = 32$ recorded continuous features.
- The data has 225 "good" ($n_g$) and 126 "bad" ($n_b$) observations for a total of 351 observations.
- We trained on 40%, 45%, ..., 90% of the observations.
- We present the results from training with 80% (280) of the observations. This training percent minimised overall CER.
- We repeated non-parametric bootstrap draws 5,000 times.

## Ionosphere Results
```{r, out.width = "810px", out.height = "500px", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/gabrielodom/Box Sync/Research/Presentations/Miami_Interview/Ion_CER_Graph.pdf")
```

## Results Discussion
- Because the ratio of $n$ to $p$ is larger, SYS and SY perform similarly.
- The Median CER without dimension reduction is 13%.
- The overall minimum Median CER is 5.6% in dimensions 8 and 9, and is attained by the SY and SYS methods.
- With LDR, we reduce the number of parameters to estimate from 1120 to 88, thereby drastically increasing the value of each observation.


## Package `covEst`
- http://covest.bearstatistics.com/
- This is our package for generating and estimating matrices.
- Use it to generate Wishart or Singular Wishart covariance matrices for simulation and estimator testing.
- Given a data matrix or data sufficent statistics, we can use it to calculate different covariance matrix estimators.
- The `covEst` package is a "helper" package for `slidR`.

## Package `slidR`
- http://slidr.bearstatistics.com/
- This package contains a collection of heteroscedastic linear dimension reduction methods useful for supervised learning.
- We designed it from the ground up to utilize pipe operators and other aspects of Hadley's `tidyverse`
- Minimum working example:
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(slidR)

df <- iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% crossv_mc(100)
classifier <- df$train %>% map(SYS, targetDim = 1) %>% map(classify)
predicted <- map2(classifier, df$test, predict)
```

<div class = "notes">
  dplyr::group_by() groups a data frame by a discrete-valued column
  modelr::crossv_mc(100) splits the data into 100 exclusive test-train partitions, without replicating these data sets in memory.
  purrr::map() is a data-frame efficient, single argument apply function
  slidR::SYS() is our dimension reduction method, and we are choosing to project the data into 1 dimension
  slidR::classify() takes in a reduced-dimension data set (from SYS, for instance), and builds a classifer from a specified discriminant function. It defaults to the quadratic classifier.
  purrr::map2() is a data-frame efficient, multiple argument apply function
  stats::predict() is what you expect - given test data and a classifier, return a prediction

# High-Dimensional Classification

## The Problem Defined
- Micro-array and -omics data are often ill-conditioned data sets ($p >> n$).
- Some classification methods are severely degraded in ill-posed scenarios.
- Other classification methods fail entirely.
- Use LDR to reduce the feature space of the data and improve classification opportunities.

## Real Data
@alon_broad_1999 present a data set on colon cancer. It has 2,000 gene expression measurements on 62 patients, 22 normal patients and 40 cases. Currently, the best mean CER of 0.1040 has been attained by @li_sparse_2015 with their Sparse Quadratic Discriminant Analysis method. The study we compare to uses these parameters:

- Randomly select a training set with 13 normal observations and 29 cases.
- Hold aside the other 9 normal observations and 11 cases as a test data set.
- Train a classifer and test it, recording the CER for that permutation.
- Repeat this sampling and classification 50 times.

We matched their design in every way, but increased the replications from 50 to 1000, reducing the simulation standard deviation to less than 0.005. Further, their classification was in the original feature space, which is far more computationally expensive.

## Conditonal Error Rates Table

Our currently tested method has the following distribution (in three-dimensional feature space):

           Min       Q1        Median    Mean      Q3        Max    
--------   -------   -------   -------   -------   -------   -------
Error      0.09054   0.09950   0.10188   0.10229   0.10457   0.11591


Other methods have the following mean conditional error rates, as given by @dettling_bagboosting_2004:

           BagBoost   RF         SVM        kNN        DLDA       Boosting   PAM        SLDA
--------   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------   --------
Mean ER    0.1610     0.1486     0.1505     0.1638     0.1286     0.1914     0.1190     0.1220

## Results Discussion
- Our method is at minimum non-inferior---and possibly superior---to the current world's best CER for this colon cancer data.
- Our method uses simple, pre-existing code to perform classification. Specifically, we have used both Friedman's RDA and QDA with squelched-correlation sparse covariance estimation as our classifiers.
- @li_sparse_2015 presented a complex method without published code or packages.
- In contrast, our method is computationally simple and quick, taking less than 3 seconds for classification in a specified dimension for Friedman's RDA (which requires internal cross-validation).





# Multi-State Multivariate Process Monitoring

## The Problem Defined
- Many factories or other closed production systems use real-time online process monitoring.
- We aim to detect potential problems within the system before they cause damage or cause the process to shut down.
- The process has many sensors (a time series for each).
- These sensor readings are not independent across time, and their values may have daily trends / perturbations (autocorrelated and non-stationary).
- The sensors themselves are not independent (cross-correlation of the multiple time series).
- Compute the Squared Prediction Error (SPE) and Hotelling's $T^2$ process monitoring statistics regularly to check divergence from Normal Operating Conditions (NOC).

## Example Process Graphs: NOC vs. Fault

```
```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/gabrielodom/Box Sync/Research/Presentations/Miami_Interview/Fault2A_20170317.png")
```

## Current Approaches
PCA fails because of the autocorrelated and non-linearity / non-stationarity of the data. These are a few of the methods currently employed:

- Adaptive-Dynamic PCA (AD-PCA) of @kazor_comparison_2016
- Kernel PCA (kPCA) of @ge_improved_2009
- Adaptive kPCA (AkPCA) of @chouaib_adaptive_2013
- Local Linear Embedding (LLE) @miao_nonlinear_2013
- Multi-dimensional scaling and isometric mapping (IsoMap) of @tenenbaum_global_2000-1
- Semidefinite Embedding (SDE) / Maximimum Variance Unfolding (MVU) of @weinberger_unsupervised_2006

## MSAD-PCA: Our Contribution
We choose to work with AD-PCA because it is simple in idea and computation and has non-inferior to superior results to more complicated methods. We followed this train of thought:

- As the process-dimension increases, computation of process statistics increase cubically. We must reduce the data dimension (PCA).
- Feature distributions change over time and are serially correlated (Adaptive-Dynamic PCA).
- Some processes have multiple states.
- Examples include brain waves during different parts of the sleep cycle or chemical concentrations in a tank during different cleaning steps.
- These states are highly discrete and can cause data matrix instability (near-0 variance).
- Feature distributions change with different known process states, so block on them (Multi-State ADPCA).

## Synthetic Data Fault Detection Time
We present the distribution of time in minutes after synthetic fault induction until the first alarm by each linear projection method. We also record the censoring percentatge for each method (OOB%), which states what percentage of the time the specified method failed to detect a fault within 24 hours. Finally, we also include the expected number of false alarms per day by method.

               0.05      Mean      0.95      OOB%   False Alarm %   False Alarms / Day
--------   --------   -------   -------   -------   -------         -------
MSAD SPE        264       370       621        0%   0.2%            2.88
MSAD T2         364       493       533        0%   0.0%            0
AD SPE          Inf       Inf       Inf      100%   0.0%            0
AD T2            35      1114      1406      2.3%   1.5%            21.6


## Real Data
- This work is motivated by our partnership with the Colorado School of Mines on the ReNUWit water preservation grant.
- Our team manages a decentralised wastewater treatment plant in Golden, CO.
- We measure 35 features and their lagged values (70 features).
- The continuous features are aggregated to the minute-level.
- We aim to develop a monitoring process capable of detecting system faults before human operators.

## Results Discussion

## Package `mvMonitoring`
- No website: our package is currently in private beta-testing at the facility.
- `mspProcessData()` generates random draws from a serially autocorrelated and nonstationary multi-state (or single-state) multivariate process.
- `mspTrain()` trains the projection matrix and fault detection components.
- `mspMonitor()` assesses incoming process observations and classifies them as normal or abnormal.
- `mspWarning()` keeps a running tally of abnormal observations and raises an alarm if necessary.
- Alarms can be sent via email or SMS from the remote facility to the operators or to the central facility.
- Our next phase goal is integrating an iPhone / Android applet for real-time mobile process updates.
